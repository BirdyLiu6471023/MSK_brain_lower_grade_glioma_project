## I focused on predicting the **Survival Rate**. 

### The features I use are
- Gene expression
- Clinical data (age, sex, race, prior diagnosis, radiation therapy...)

### The models I used:

- LASSO
- Random Forest
- GradientBoosting
- SVM
- Cox Survival Model Elastic Net

### Results
- Cox Elastic Net is the only decent model, with **92%** R2 on testing data
- Feature importance
